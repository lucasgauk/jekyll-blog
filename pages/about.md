## Me

The soft cheese is a lie. I'm a 23 year old software engineer from Edmonton Alberta. I studied computer engineering
at the University of Alberta before moving into web development. 

## This site

A catalog of things I think are cool, 
solutions to problems that I could't find well documented online, 
and general thoughts about programming and life.
